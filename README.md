# Project Portfolio

### Welcome to my Project Portfolio for the Team Treehouse: FSJS Techdegree - Unit 6 Project.

This portfolio displays the first five projects I completed in the Team Treehouse: Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree. \
Selecting a project takes you to the description page where you can view screenshots or click links taking you either to a live version of the project, or to the GitHub repository.

This portfolio's features include: \
:heavy_check_mark: Breakdowns of languages used in each project. \
:heavy_check_mark: Custom styling. \
:heavy_check_mark: Custom error pages with "back" buttons to return to safety.

Thanks for visiting! \
Feedback, follows, and stars are all appreciated!

Developer's Notes: 
- In styles.css from line 262 to line 270, I changed the original box-shadow properties and added other properties for a more defined mouse hovering effect.
- Changed sidebar color by changing the sidebar *and* body background color in styles.css at lines 25 and 140, respectively. 
- Changed about page and project pages button colors in styles.css at line 306.
